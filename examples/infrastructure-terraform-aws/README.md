# Terraform - AWS Infrastructure Example

This directory contains [Terraform], infrastructure definitions, which can be used to run [Arcwell] on 
[AWS] (Amazon Web Services). This example is fairly robust, but should of course, be checked for production readiness. 
It is assumed that the user of this example has familiarity with Terraform, and AWS.
