Mailhog is an email interceptor, run as a container in development
beside Arcwell services to test delivery and facilitate development
of email templates.

GitHub: https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog
Docker Hub: https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/mailhog/mailhog/

The container is a bit outdated and the Arcwell development team are
considering alternatives for this purpose in future releases.
